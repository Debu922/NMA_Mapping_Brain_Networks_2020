# Mapping Brain Networks - NMA 2020 Project

This project is a part of the Neuromatch Acedemy's summer school in July 2020.

## Description

During a decision making task, a number of brain regions are involved in the processing of sensory information to decision making to motor action. These regions act together in particular networks. Weâ€™re aware of the anatomical organisation of these regions but the dynamical interactions among them, is not well established.


How do the different brain regions interact with one another in terms of functional connectivity? Can we attribute behaviour to large-scale brain wide circuits? Are different networks involved in different tasks?

## Dataset

The dataset used for this purpose was the [Steinmetz et al. 2019](https://figshare.com/articles/steinmetz/9598406) data set that was recorded using Neuropixel probes.
